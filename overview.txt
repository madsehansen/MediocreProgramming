Subjects:

Class design
    Data holder
        struct vs class
        Minimal but complete
        Copy and move
        Value semantics
            Constructors
            Operators
            Destructor
        Do not waste space, there could be many of these in a collection, size affects speed
    Business logic
        May hide behind interface
        Minimal state, mostly operate on arguments
        Few (one?) instances of each concrete type, potentially many implementations of interface
    IO classes
        Hides behind interfaces
        Always at least two implementations, program and test-stub
    Resource manager
        RAII
    Generally
        Avoid dependencies
        Keep headers small, less compile-time
        Private methods can be moved to free functions
        Some private methods can be new algorithms
        Private data can be hidden with pImpl-idiom

Function design
    Naming
    Arguments
    Return value
    Argument order
    Contract
    Do or do not
    Pure functions
    Const variables
    constexpr

Type theory light
    What is a type
        Values and operations
        Is-a, Has-a, is-implemented-in-terms-of
    Why make types/type safety
        Use the compiler to eliminate semantic bugs
    Arithmetical types, sum and product
        Product types
            struct
            tuple
            pair
        Sum types
            optional
            variant
            any
    Use types to describe problem space
        Make undefined/illegal behaviour impossible

Unit testing
    Why have unit tests
        Make better design
        Specify what should happen (test requirements)
        Avoid debugger (that is a slow process)
        Avoid starting application (which can take time and then you have to rummage around to get to what you want to test)
        Allow refactoring with confidence
        Catch bugs
        Faster development (less time from coding to coding)
    How to write tests
        Test one thing, if it fails it failed for one reason
        Name the test accordingly, if it fails the name basically tells you what is wrong
        This makes for many testcases, which is a good thing
        Test either a free function or a class' behaviour, not a method
    How to make code testable
        Separate concerns into separate entities
            Code not really part of the class/function should be separated and tested separately
            IO, time and timers are separate entities from the class under test
        Inject dependencies
            This allows for faster tests
            Also easy test of dependency usage
            Better design in general
        No global/static/singleton data unless actually constant over all runs
            These make testcases talk to eachother
            They make for weird and hard to find bugs
            Code becomes hard to reason about since there can be spooky action at a distance
    Speed of running translates to number of runs
        Tests should run in < 1ms per testcase
        Tests should be independent of other tests (order of execution)
        There should be many (hundreds or thousands) of testcases for medium sized projects
        Tests should ideally be part of the normal build (a buildstep)
            Failing tests are bugs found before starting application -> Big win
    The tests are part of the system
        Not an afterthought
        Must be maintained with the rest of the code

Standard library
    Avoid reimplementing standard functionality
        The standard library is huge and contains a lot of goodies
        The implementers are better at it than you are
        If reimplementing standard functionality is OK for you, where do you draw the line? printf()?
    Efficient use of collections
        Almost always array or vector
        Memory allocation cost
        Data overhead for node-based containers
        Cost of cache misses
        Reallocation
            vector reallocates when it needs to grow
                Copies/moves data to new buffer
                iterators and references are invalidated
                reserve() can fix problem
            Node-based containers do not copy/move elements
                iterators and references are stable unless element is removed
                Copies/moves data only once (into container), unless emplaced
                Still slower than vector for most usecases (memcpy and sequential access is fast, new and random walk is slow)
    Lambdas, return them from functions
        This gives them a name
        Lambdas have a type, keep the number of types low
        Should be small, large lambdas should be or call functions
        IILE for initialization, sometimes
    Common algorithms
        any_of()
        all_of()
        none_of()
        find_if()
        transform()
        sort()
        for_each()
    Not so common algorithms
        generate()
        partition()
        nth_element()
        copy_if()
        accumulate()

Extend the standard with your own
    Collections
        Why make new ones?
        Implement in terms of existing collection
        Create one from scratch
        Remember iterators!
    Algorithms
        Why make them?
        Implement in terms of existing algorithms
        Create one from scratch
        Return something useful
