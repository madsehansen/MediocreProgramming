Functional programming

Functional programming is about managing complexity
    Through hiding it in functions with a small and controlled responsability
    The functions can be passed into other functions to build more complex functions
    Shared interfaces allows functions to be treated similarily even though that may lead to very different results
    Generic functions are very useful
    Template meta-programming is basically functional in nature

Functions may use eachother
    Can be passed as arguments to eachother
    Can be used as return values
    Composes so that it is easy to use them together
    C++ does not have a full support for this, but it can do a lot of it

Types
    Functional programming is typically very type oriented
    Functions are overloaded on argument type

Values
    Functional programming often uses immutable data
    This leads to very threadsafe code
    It is often slower than imperative programming
    C++ allows imperative programming mixed with functional for best of several worlds

Functional programming then gives frameworks where it is
    Hard to add types
        They need to be supported by all functions they will be used in
        Framework built to have all supported types
        Clients can typically not extend with new types
        Adding new types to framework causes all clients to have to modify their functions
    Easy to add functionality
        Clients can add any number of new functions
        Adding new functions to framework does not affect clients

Function template
    Basically a way to make it easy to add types
    Comes with the cost that the types must support the same interface
    Comes with the cost that the function will be duplicated for each type
